Zen Dash
========

Remove individual widgets from the WordPress Dashboard. Many of my clients find the sheer volume of information a bit intimidating. I wanted to create an easy to use, codeless, great looking solution to toggle the widgets users don't want so see.

This Plugin was inspired by Joseph Lowery when he kindly explained how to remove dashboard widgets.

Special thanks to Kushagara Agarwal for the wonderful CSS.
